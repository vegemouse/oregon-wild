## Description

Create a site replica of Arctic Wild, a wilderness guiding company based in Alaska. Use Flexbox as the driving force of your layout (no floats!), but don't be afraid to use familiar tools such as absolute/relative positioning where appropriate. At minimum you should build down as far as the gallery (see screenshot below). Your images must include hover effects using transform and/or transition. The page must also be responsive at at least one breakpoint. Assets do not need to be the same.
